Road Problem Request Extraction via Web Scraping
================================================

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of extracting road problem requests from a specified source using web scraping techniques and transforming the data into a structured format for analysis. The notebook is divided into two main sections:

1\. Import Libraries
--------------------

This section imports all the necessary Python libraries required for web scraping and data manipulation. The specific libraries and their uses might include:

*   HTTP request handling.
*   HTML/XML parsing.
*   Data manipulation and analysis.

2\. Transform JSON to DataFrame
-------------------------------

After extracting the data, this section focuses on converting the JSON formatted data into a pandas DataFrame. This transformation is key to enabling efficient data analysis, as it organizes the data into a structured tabular form.

### Prerequisites

*   Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
*   Familiarity with pandas and data manipulation.

### How to Use

*   Ensure all the necessary libraries are installed.
*   Run each cell in sequence to perform the web scraping and data transformation.

This notebook is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating how to extract and manipulate data from the web.
